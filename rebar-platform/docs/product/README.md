# Product Docs Index

This folder now separates near-term build specs from long-horizon vision so engineers can focus on what ships next.

- **Current delivery tracks:**
  - `mvp_spec.md` and `pallet_planning.md` cover the workflows needed for the first production vertical slice.
  - `bender_app_spec.md`, `cutter_app_spec.md`, and `optimization.md` outline the planning and bending experiences that feed that slice.
- **Reference designs:**
  - `ai_voice_agent_spec.md`, `ar_v2_vision.md`, `three_chart_bending_primitive.md`, and `appsheet_rebar_cutting_blueprint.md` document supporting flows and experiments.
- **Future vision:**
  - Long-range ideas now live under [`future-vision/`](./future-vision/) to avoid conflating aspirational strategy with scoped execution.

When proposing changes, keep near-term specs in this directory and move horizon pieces into `future-vision/` so the roadmap stays realistic.
