# AR V2 Vision

Future release to overlay bend marks and cut lengths via AR on the shop floor. Requires ruggedized devices, computer vision alignment, and tight latency budgets; deferred until the core workflows are stable.

Pallet planning is a key precursor: once pallets and layers are suggested in software (see [Pallet Planning Spec](./pallet_planning.md)),
the same geometry can power simple AR overlays that show where each bundle should sit on the deck.
