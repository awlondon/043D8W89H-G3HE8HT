# Future Vision Docs

This folder holds long-horizon concepts that inform direction but are **not** part of the current delivery scope.

- Keep execution specs and day-to-day user stories in the parent `docs/product` directory.
- Store multi-year strategies, moonshots, and exploratory bench ideas here to prevent them from distorting near-term planning.
- Reference these documents when aligning stakeholders, but avoid treating them as committed roadmap items.
