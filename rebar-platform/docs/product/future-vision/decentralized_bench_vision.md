# Decentralized Bench Network Vision

This roadmap connects the near-term rebar cutting app to a decade-long push toward distributed, autonomous fabrication benches. Each phase lists the primary objective, non-negotiable moves, and expected outcomes.

## Years 0–1 | Foundation: Cash, Credibility, Control
- **Objective:** Survive, self-fund, prove competence.
- **Moves:**
  - Ship the rebar cutting app, then the bender app—cash flow is non-negotiable because it buys time and autonomy.
  - Standardize workflows and codify tribal knowledge.
  - Begin abstracting workflows into machine-readable logic.
  - Run parallel R&D on the tool-swapping transmission (treat it like a kernel, not a feature).
- **Outcome:** Revenue, validated process logic, and a mechanical IP seed.

## Years 1–3 | Distribution: Physical Presence Everywhere
- **Objective:** Put capability in people’s hands.
- **Moves:**
  - Launch Vendor Bench first (mobility over polish), followed immediately by the human-powered Residential Home Bench.
  - Make the transmission the standard interface across all benches.
  - Roll in the Sanitation Bench to establish hygiene and trust.
  - Create open-but-governed standards for tool modules.
- **Outcome:** Thousands of distributed capability nodes with no dependency on factories or centralized choke points—real decentralization starts here.

## Years 3–5 | Automation: Scale Without Corporations
- **Objective:** Multiply capability without multiplying labor.
- **Moves:**
  - Introduce the semi-autonomous Bot Bench.
  - Graduate the workflow app into orchestration software fed by Residential and Vendor benches.
  - Make small-scale local manufacturing viable again and shift training to bench-mediated learning.
- **Outcome:** Human + machine hybrid productivity and local economies retaining value instead of exporting it—the first fracture in extractive capitalism.

## Years 5–7 | Network Effect: Decentralization Becomes Obvious
- **Objective:** Make the old system inefficient by comparison.
- **Moves:**
  - Interconnect bench ecosystems globally so designs, fixes, and upgrades circulate faster than products.
  - Push markets toward materials, modules, verification, and maintenance; let centralized mass production of low-complexity goods fade.
  - Drive adoption by governments and NGOs for resilience (not ideology).
- **Outcome:** Decentralization is cheaper, faster, safer—the tipping point.

## Years 7–10 | Autonomy: Proof Beyond Earth
- **Objective:** Demonstrate permanence.
- **Moves:**
  - Deploy BenchBots in extreme environments (deserts, ice, subsurface) to prove closed-loop repair, fabrication, and autonomy.
  - Treat space deployment as validation, not escape, and push Residential bench logic to become a civilizational default.
- **Outcome:** Decentralization is irreversible—not because anyone “won,” but because re-centralization cannot keep up.

## What This Timeline Actually Does
- It does **not** destroy capitalism; it destroys dependency as a profit center.
- It shifts power from owning factories to owning capability.
- It replaces “jobs” with productive agency.
- The result is infrastructure people refuse to give up.
