# Pricing Scenarios

- **Starter shop**: 5 seats at $150/seat/mo, AI outbound optional.
- **Growth**: 15 seats at $135/seat/mo, includes OCR/optimization credits.
- **Multi-shop**: 30+ seats at custom pricing, dedicated success + quarterly calibration.

Pallet planning and stacking guidance are strong value drivers for larger shops that need to document forklift lift limits and
reduce restacking; position them as part of the Growth+ bundles.
