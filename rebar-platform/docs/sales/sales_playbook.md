#### Pallet Planning & Forklift Safety

- The app groups bent pieces into pallet “recipes” with weight totals and layer-by-layer instructions.
- It prevents overloaded pallets that forklifts can’t lift.
- It reduces restacking and banding failures.
- See [Pallet Planning Spec](../product/pallet_planning.md) for the technical design.
