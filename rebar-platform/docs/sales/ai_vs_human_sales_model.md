# AI vs Human Sales Model

- **AI-closed deals**: marketing fund receives the full baseline commission; human reps at 0%.
- **AI-sourced, human-closed**: split commissions between rep (5%) and marketing fund (5%).
- Anti-sniping: active leads remain with assigned reps unless stale or explicitly reassigned.
